# Private Transfer Module (Coming Soon)

The Private Transfer module implements Qelva’s privacy-enhanced sending features using:

- Split & Delay execution
- Relayer-based transaction routing
- Randomized scheduling
- Multi-output transaction splitting
- Address unlinkability through personas

This module is currently in development.  
It will serve as the core engine for secure, obfuscated transfers on Solana.

## Goals
- Break sender–receiver linkability
- Reduce timing analysis risk
- Improve privacy posture across personas
- Provide a simple UX for private sending
